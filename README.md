# odin-landing-page
This is my CSS Basics final project for the Odin Project. 
In this I am synthesizing all the information I've learned about basic HTML and CSS. I used flexbox to organise my page layout. 
I attempted to perfectly recreate the page layout example provided to me by the Odin Project and plan to use it as a template to make a more personalised webpage. 
The links I have included direct you to webpages and a website about crochet, my favourite hobby.
